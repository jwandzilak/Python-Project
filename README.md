# Python-Project
This repository contains two python scripts.

1. kmers.py : This script can be run on a command line with any nucleotide sequence. It will produce a pandas dataframe with k values, observed kmers, and possible kmers for the given nuclotide sequnce. It will also create a plot showing porportion of observed kmers to possible kmers for all k values. 
test_kmers.py : This file contains functions which test the functions in the kmers.py script. This file should be used by going to the directory that has this file on the command line and running "pytest".
